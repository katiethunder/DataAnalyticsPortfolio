# Data Analytics Portfolio


Hi! I'm Katie, a Data Analyst with a background in Social Science. I've always been interested in data and technology, but my experience working in the social care sector showed me how powerful data-driven decisions can be. Seeing how data can create change led me to pursue a career in data analytics.

I'm motivated by the opportunity to use data to solve problems and support better decision-making. My goal is to apply my technical skills to make a real impact—wherever data can make positive change.


### What I Do
I work with data. Cleaning, analyzing, and transforming it into meaningful insights. My skills include:

- 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation – Handling incomplete, inconsistent, and unstructured datasets
- 📊 Data Analysis – Extracting insights with SQL, R, and MongoDB
- 📈 Data Visualization – Creating clear and impactful reports with Tableau
- 🏛 Database Querying & Scripting – Working with PL/SQL
- 📉 Statistical Analysis – Using Minitab and R for data-driven decision-making
- 📄 Reporting & Documentation – Communicating findings effectively with R Markdown, Jupyter Notebooks & Tableau

I enjoy exploring complex datasets, uncovering trends, and helping turn data into smarter decisions.

## Portfolio Projects
This portfolio is a collection of projects that I have completed as part of my Higher Diploma in Data Analytics as well as some personal projects. The portfolio is very much a work in progress, with new projects to come as I develop my skills and learn new techniques and technologies. If you have any questions about the projects, please feel free to reach out, my contact details are below.
