# Data Analytics Portfolio


Hi! I'm Katie, a Data Analyst with a background in Social Science. I've always been interested in data and technology, but my experience working in the social care sector showed me how powerful data-driven decisions can be. Seeing how data can create change led me to pursue a career in data analytics.

I‚Äôm motivated by the opportunity to use data to solve problems and support better decision-making. My goal is to apply my technical skills to make a real impact‚Äîwherever data can make positive change.


### What I Do
I work with data. Cleaning, analyzing, and transforming it into meaningful insights. My skills include:

- üßπ Data Cleaning & Preparation ‚Äì Handling incomplete, inconsistent, and unstructured datasets
- üìä Data Analysis ‚Äì Extracting insights with SQL, R, and MongoDB
- üìà Data Visualization ‚Äì Creating clear and impactful reports with Tableau
- üèõ Database Querying & Scripting ‚Äì Working with PL/SQL
- üìâ Statistical Analysis ‚Äì Using Minitab and R for data-driven decision-making
- üìÑ Reporting & Documentation ‚Äì Communicating findings effectively with R Markdown, Jupyter Notebooks & Tableau

I enjoy exploring complex datasets, uncovering trends, and helping turn data into smarter decisions.

## Portfolio Projects
This portfolio is a collection of projects that I have completed as part of my Higher Diploma in Data Analytics as well as some personal projects. The portfolio is very much a work in progress, with new projects to come as I develop my skills and learn new techniques and technologies.
